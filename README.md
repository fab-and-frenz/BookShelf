# BookShelf

A place to put your books.

BookShelf allows you to serve up an entire library of ebooks through http, so they can be read through the web browser of any device.

## Roadmap

Below I list planned features for BookShelf.

* Allow users to create "shelves" (categories) to organize books into.
* Allow users to upload books to the server from other devices.
* Allow users to password-protect the server.
* Allow users to make annotations to books.
* Allow users to search for books with the search bar.
* Allow users to filter books by author, genre, etc.
* Allow users to edit metadata for books.

## File Support

Below is a table showing the current support for different ebook filetypes.
Everything listed in the table is planned to be added in the future.
You may request other formats by opening an issue in Github!
